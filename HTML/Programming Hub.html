            <strong>S</strong>eparated means set apart. When you have an apostolic mandate (not necessarily the office of the Apostle), there would be separation. 
            Apostolic mandate means you are in the go for Christ. You follow His steps, and that’s your marching orders. 
            As believers who seek intimacy with God, you will encounter this apostolic mandate.
            Because of that, you have to learn separation or God will ensure your separation.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="mandate">
        When the apostolic mandate is set rolling, you start losing friends. It is natural with this mandate. 
        You will lose interest in things that distract you from God. The earlier, the bet-ter

        If you are here but not born again, you are on a cruise ship without a ticket. 
        When you are found, you will be deported to the shore first to get a ticket and join a ship. 
        The Lord Jesus Himself will do the deportation, and at the end, you would have just wasted your time.

        The three stages in Apostle Paul’s tells us something;
        To the believer who wants to live for Christ, at every stage of your life, God is calling you to a place of separation. 
        As a new convert, separation. Senior apostle, separation.

        A man’s title in Kumasi here is Major Seer, Nyame Nipa, Nyame Akoa, Nyame Diifo), Papa, Daddy, then his name comes; even at this level, separation. 
        Your level in Christ does not exempt you from separation. Are you a student? Separation. At dinners, sepa-ration. In the kind of music, you want to choose, separation.
        Your type of movies, separa-tion; forget Bella Chao, separation. Are you on tik tok, your kind of post? Separation!

        What deceives us into sin majorly is because we don’t know when to separate. When you have to fast, separate your appetite from Jollof and Omo tuo. 
        I don’t know which part of our lives that would not call for a level of separation. Separation everywhere!
    </div><br>
    <section class="visible">
         If we learn the way of separation, Oh God, the Lord will find you usable.
If your HEART is not SEPARATED from a thing, your physical separation is a joke.
If your desire for fair ladies is above the will of God on your life, do 79 days fasting. 
The day you return from Atwea, it is only fair ladies you will see for one week
